## Sales-Related Q&A

<details>
    <summary><b>Can we install the customer's battery if they already have a battery?</b></summary>
    <p>
        <b>Yes.</b> In the past, we would DC couple the system, however, in reality, we don't need to DC couple the system. We can just install the battery as-is into their current system. The batteries won't be able to communicate with eachother, and the customer will have to use two different apps to manage the batteries and see their total storage between these apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        The customer can set it up in their apps for the order in which their batteries charge, so this doesn't affect their system whatsoever.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Do our batteries work off-grid?</b></summary>
    <p>
        <b>No.</b> The customer does not qualify for the rebates if their battery is for an off-grid system. We also do not have the installers currently to install off-grid systems.
    </p>
</details>

## Compliance-Related Q&A

<details>
    <summary><b>What does Compliance need to process a Grid Application?</b></summary>
    <p>
        Compliance needs all of the following.
        <ul>
            <li>A <b>clear, full-shot</b> photo of the customer's meterbox internals. Has to be the whole meterbox.</li>
            <ul>
               <li>If the customer does not have a switchboard in their meterbox, we need a clear photo of their entire switchboard.</li>    
            </ul>
            <li>The customer's <b>full</b> electricity bill. All pages are needed.</li>
            <li>The customer's Inverter Compliance Sticker. This is located on the sides of the inverter (or under the inverter if it is a Fronius). It must clearly state the Brand and Model Number of the inverter.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>What if the customer cannot identify their inverter?</b></summary>
    <p>
        If the customer has ever had solar. Compliance needs to know their Inverter Brand and Model Number to submit the grid application. This is no exception. If the customer is unaware of their brand and model number, we need them to contact their previous installers and get a copy of their invoice to send to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compliance knows that the customer has had an inverter based on their electricity bill, and their "Main Inverter Supply Switch"/"Main Solar Supply Switch". If their meterbox contains those switches, Compliance needs their inverter brand and model number.
