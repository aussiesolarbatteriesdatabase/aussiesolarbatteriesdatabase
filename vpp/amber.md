Amber Electrics SmartShift automatically operates, allowing customers to take advantage of wholesale prices, selling when it is high, and buying electricity when it is low in cost. It uses AI to automatically do this. It's main draw is the fact that you can sort of set-and-forget it to still maximise it's potential, and it isn't as hands-on as other VPP's.

- **Maximized earnings during price spikes:** By exposing you to real-time wholesale prices, SmartShift can enable your battery to sell stored energy to the grid at very high rates during rare price spikes, sometimes earning more in a day than through weeks of standard feed-in tariffs.
- **Faster battery payback:** Strategically charging when wholesale prices are low and discharging when they are high can significantly shorten the payback period of your battery investment.
- **No profit sharing:** Unlike many VPPs, Amber passes the full wholesale export value through to you without taking a cut.
- **Bill guarantee:** Amber offers a guarantee that ensures you will not pay more than the Default Market Offer over a year, providing a safety net against sustained high prices.
- **Set-and-forget optimization:** SmartShift automates your battery's charging and discharging based on wholesale prices, solar forecasts, and your household's usage, taking  the guesswork out of daily optimization.
- **Personalized plans:** The algorithm creates a customized plan for your specific battery and load profile, rather than using a fleet-wide strategy.
- **Full manual override:** Despite the automation, you retain full control via the app. You can manually set your battery to charge, discharge, or preserve its current level at any time.
- **In-depth insights:** The Amber app provides a high level of transparency, showing real-time wholesale prices, your battery's planned actions, and projected earnings
