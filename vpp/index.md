Virtual Power Plants (**VPP**) are a system that have multiple power resources that provide grid power, essentially connecting all customer's power and batteries together to generate electricity for those apart of the VPP. They allow for energy resources that are too small (e.g. the use of a battery) to be used en masse to store and generate power.

There are two main VPP's that are compatible with our FOXESS Batteries, these are:

- [Amber Energy](amber)
- [Globird](globird)

## Amber vs Globird

Amber Energy's SmartShift is **Automatic**. You pay a flat, monthly subscription fee and your prices are of wholesale rates, varying with the market itself. It automatically charges when prices are low, and exports when prices are high.

Globird's ZEROHERO plan is **Manually Controlled**. You do not need to pay anything to sign up, you just need to qualify. You have to actively manage your usage and battery charging times to maximise your savings, but it is a lot more predictable. You also have a free power period between 11am and 2pm to charge your battery or run appliances.
