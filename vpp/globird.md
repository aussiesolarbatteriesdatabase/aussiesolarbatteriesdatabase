- **Free grid charging:** The ZeroHero plan offers three hours of free electricity from the grid each day (11 a.m. to 2 p.m.), which can be used to charge a battery, especially on cloudy days.
- **Daily credit:** ZeroHero offers a daily credit for minimizing grid imports during the evening peak, which helps offset the daily supply charge.
- **Customer-controlled battery:** The plan gives you full, manual control over your battery's operation, with GloBird never discharging it without your permission. This is a key feature for customers who want to retain control over their investment.
- **Super export credit:** ZeroHero offers a bonus feed-in tariff for exporting to the grid during the evening peak, a time when grid electricity is expensive.
- **No lock-in contract:** ZeroHero does not lock you into a contract, so you are free to leave if the terms change.
