If you are having trouble making sales and want to improve the amount of people signing, this section covers a good list of advice and techniques you can use.

## The Most Important Information

A lot of the people here that make sales are able to do so because they are calm, confident and are able to relate to the people they are talking to. They:

- Know everything there is to know about the battery and inverter
- Can confidently give an answer for most topics about the battery
- Confidently know when to stand their ground about the battery and don't cave in to people-pleasing
- Can identify whether the battery or solar is suitable for them.
- Arranging times with the customer in following up, and contacting the customer to answer questions

The key is to not sound desperate. Despite your sales role, your job isn't to sell them the battery, this is not an outbound role. They've asked to be contacted one way or the other, your job is to get them to convince you that the battery and solar is suitable for them.

Be honest, be truthful and know your limits. Asking for more leads is going to get more sales, sure, but if you are consistent and confident in your information, you will get a higher rate of conversions and won't need to worry about high yield sales rates. Treat them as if they're people, speak to them and learn about their outside lives and see if the battery suits their needs. Don't be afraid to say no and be blunt to people who you think are unsure whether they want the battery or not.

If you absolutely don't know something, let them know that it's a good question, and arrange a call-back regarding more information for them. This shows that you are reliable and are actively sorting out their questions and grievances.

The Fox ESS is a good product that sells itself, familiarising yourself with it will help you understand that it is one of the best solar batteries on the market currently.
