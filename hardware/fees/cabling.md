**Additional Cost**: +$100 per meter of cabling beyond 10m.

These orange cables are used to connect systems together, we offer about 10m of free cabling to start with. Electricians normally use whatever is the cheapest cable that they have on hand, it varies with each individual installer.

Single phase systems use a 2C+E Cable containing two main cores and one earth core.

Three Phase systems use 4C+E cables, containing four main cores and one earth core.

| Cabling Types | Dimensions (mm)     |

| Single Phase  | 10-16mm<sup>2</sup> |
| Three Phase   | 4-6mm<sup>2</sup>   |
