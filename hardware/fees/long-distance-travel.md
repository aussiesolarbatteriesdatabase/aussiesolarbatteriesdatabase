**Additional Costs**: For all properties past 100km, +$2.50 per km from the CBD.

We charge a long distance travel fee because fuel and storage is expensive beyond these points. These roads are also usually not the best, so it requires a lot more precarious and precaution.

**If the customer is located past 100km, we must charge the first 100km**
