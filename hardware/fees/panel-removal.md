**Additional Costs**:  
+$50 per panel removed   
+$300 for disconnecting & removing old inverter  
+$500 for disconnecting & removing old battery

If the customer has old panels, inverters and parts, and wants us to remove them, maybe to fit new panels, or their new inverter and battery in a location on their property, this is how much we charge for them.

**Note**: Customer MUST dispose of the removed panels/inverter/battery themselves. The installers do not take these items with them.
