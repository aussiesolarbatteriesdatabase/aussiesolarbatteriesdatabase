**Additional Cost**: +$500

If a customer's house is a double storey, we charge an additional cost to install solar panels and move batteries to a second floor. The batteries themselves are heavy, and the installation and logistics of putting a panel on a double storey is a lot more difficult than just a single-storey house.
