description: 
---

This cable allows single-phase systems to be connected to the meterbox. This is merely for the use of connecting the system to the meterbox and for measuring the amount of power, as it carries a small, scaled down version of the current from the inverter's power to the meter tiself.

If you see this in the notes of a customer, this means the house is Single Phase.
