**Additional Costs**: $20 per panel

Tilts optimise the position of the panel to allow for more sun to hit the panel, maximising the efficiency and sunlight that hits the PV cells of the panel, this is good for houses that receive shade if they were laid flat on a roof, but would have some sunlight if they were tilted upright.
