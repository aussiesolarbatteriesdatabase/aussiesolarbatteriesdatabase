**Additional Cost**: $100 per panel.

Optimisers are attached to the panel, allowing them to operate at their highest capacity and prevent systems from not generating as much power drastically. They work by adjusting the voltage on shaded or dirty panels and cranking it up to hit it's peak energy amount, preventing other panels from slowing down in terms of power gain.
