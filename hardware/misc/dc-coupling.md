DC Coupling is a method that connects the panels directly to the battery's inverter, which goes into the meterbox itself and powers the whole home. Whatever excess power is made from the panels charges the battery itself.

The main benefit of DC Coupling is that it increases the efficiency of power in a system by allowing it to remain at 98% efficiency (compared to AC coupling's 90% efficiency).

**We don't normally recommend customers go with DC Coupling, especially if they are in NSW and do not need it. Only talk about DC Coupling if the customer asks about it.**

**Note: We cannot DC Couple Enphase/Microinverter systems. It is not possible.**

## When to talk about DC Coupling.

**Do not sell DC Coupling to customers** <u>unless</u> the customer falls under one the following:

- <u>NEW</u> Panel & Battery install;
- Customer Panels are installed after 2023 and the cables are 4mm (1500v)
- QLD where GSD requirements are applicable.
