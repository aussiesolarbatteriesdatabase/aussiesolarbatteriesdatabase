The Three Phase Smart Meter allows our Single Phase packages (Basic, Standard and Plus) to be compatible with Three-Phase homes across all three phases. This is a requirement to add to plans if the property is three-phase and they have chosen a single phase plan. **It adds an additional cost of $500 to the quote.**

If you have a customer who doesn't want the meter but needs it, inform them that this is the cheapest option for the recommended plan. It will give them trust in you as a salesperson and help them stay with the install.
