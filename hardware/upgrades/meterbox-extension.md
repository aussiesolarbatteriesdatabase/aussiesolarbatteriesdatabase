**Additional Cost**: +$500

Meterbox Extensions are simply additional boxes that are added onto the main meterbox to store the extra cables, switches and meters that we need to install to make sure the battery is operational.

There is no one standard size for a meterbox extension, and is usually brought by the Electrician that performs the installation. If customer's ask for a specific sized meterbox, we are unable to provide this. It is recommended to tell the customer to purchase their own meterbox they would like to use for the electrician in this instance.

## "Is this meterbox full?"

If you think the customer's meterbox is full, or if you're doubting yourself in this question, add the Meterbox Extension anyways. If the customer doesn't need it, the electricians will not charge the customer for the extension. Trust your own intuition here when adding the meterbox extension, if the customer needs it, Compliance will merely tell you to get the customer to re-sign the contract with a meterbox extension, which isn't a big deal.

(photos will be added soon for different kinds of meterboxes, trust the above advice for now.)
