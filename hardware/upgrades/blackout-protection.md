**Additional Cost**: +$300 per backup switch.

Blackout Protection switches are exactly as they sound -- they allow the battery to kick into power when the system is not being charged by the grid. This switch is almost instantaneous, around 40 miliseconds of time for it to kick in for the FOXESS Battery, making it non-observable to the human eye.

They work by having two inputs and an output, these power inputs are the battery and the grid, and the output is the entire electricity on that switch. Usually, the grid input charges the battery, but as soon as no power is going through the grid input, the switch automatically moves to the battery's input.

This process is all automatic and instantaneous, the customer does not need to change it over.
