The Inverter is the brain and functions of the system. Inverters are required for the battery unit, as the battery itself doesn't have an inbuilt inverter due to it's large size and storage capacity.

The inverters that we sell work in conjunction with the batteries and systems that we sell them with, and each work at their specified rates on each of our packages given the fact that the solar system can meet the energy requirements needed to keep the system operating at that level.

## General Information

- All inverters feature smart systems and cloud apps which allow you to track your usage and set parameters. [The FoxCloud 2.0 datasheet has more information regarding this](https://ecopartnersuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Cloud-V2.0-Quick-Guide-1.pdf).
- Is IP-65 Rated, meaning weatherproof and dustproof as the battery is.
- 10 years manufacturer warranty.
