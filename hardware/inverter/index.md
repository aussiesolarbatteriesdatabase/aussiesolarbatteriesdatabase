<sup>1 - Our most commonly sold inverters are KH8 and KH10 model FOXESS inverters.Â </sup>  
<sup> [A detailed datasheet can be found here.](https://www.fox-ess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EN-KH-KA-Datasheet-V2.0-20241127.pdf)</sup>

The Inverter is the brain and functions of the system. Inverters are required for the battery unit, as the battery itself doesn't have an inbuilt inverter due to it's large size and storage capacity.

<sup>1 - The Basic inverter is a different model, and it's dimensions are 434mm width, 418mm height, and 185mm depth. It has a Max Charge/Discharge rate of 40 Amps  
2 - The Ultra and Ultra Plus inverters are a different model, and it's dimensions are 600mm width, 450mm height, and 226mm depth. It has a Max Charge/Discharge rate of 50 Amps</sup>  

The inverters that we sell work in conjunction with the batteries and systems that we sell them with, and each work at their specified rates on each of our packages given the fact that the solar system can meet the energy requirements needed to keep the system operating at that level.

## General Information

- All inverters feature smart systems and cloud apps which allow you to track your usage and set parameters. [The FoxCloud 2.0 datasheet has more information regarding this](https://ecopartnersuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fox-Cloud-V2.0-Quick-Guide-1.pdf).
- Is IP-65 Rated, meaning weatherproof and dustproof as the battery is.
- 10 years manufacturer warranty.

### "How much power can the inverter handle?"

You might get this question from a few customers who might look at the information datasheets and be confused, such as seeing the max charge/discharge rate. The answer merely is "It should discharge the same amount that it can charge as stated on the package". So a 5kw inverter should be able to charge and discharge up to 5kwh.

Think of the inverter like the valve of a water pipe, a bigger inverter simply allows for more electricity to go through the grid.
