Solar Systems are pretty simple and straightforward once you know how they generally function and how they're installed. This section goes over a simple explanation of how Solar Systems are installed and what's best for them.

If you have someone who's attempting to install solar for the first time, or you're unsure on how to identify what would be the best for their home, this page is for you.

## How do Solar Systems work?

Please refer to the image below.

Here's how each component functions.

- **Solar Panels** - Uses Photovoltaic (PV) cells designed to capture photons and transfer their energy to electrons, creating Direct Current (DC) Electricity.
- **Solar Inverter** - Turns DC Electricity into Alternating Current (AC) Electricity so it can match with the grid's electricity and home's electricity needs. Essentially the main gateway of the entire solar system.
- **Battery** - Stores excess, unused electricity as DC Electricity. Before using from the grid, the Inverter takes charge from the battery.
- **Electrical Panel** (a.k.a **Switchboard**) - Controls the electricity of the home directly.
- **Energy Meter** - Located in the Meterbox, shows how much electricity is being used at the home, how much was exported to the grid, and how much was taken from the grid.

**<u>Don't homes mainly use DC Electricity?</u>**  
Some devices in homes <u>do</u> use DC Electricity, but a large majority of home devices e.g. lights, fridges and other appliances use AC Electricity. DC Electricity is mainly used for computers and phones, typically anything that uses a battery is using DC Electricity.

AC is generally more efficient cost-wise to build homes with and is generally much more safer to control in case of failure, while DC is typically more powerful and requires more expensive equipment to convert.

## Electric Phases and their differences

To use electricity in a home, the home has to be wired in either Single, Three or Split (Two) Phase. Each individual phase of a system is used to supply an AC Current waveform to the home. Most homes are built in Single Phase, but more modern homes and industrial properties tend to be built with Three Phase

- **Single** - Features one live wire and one neutral wire. Used for low-electricity applications
- **Three** - Features three live wires and one neutral wire.

To easily identify whether a home is single or three phase, there's two main methods, both used for their meterbox:

- The amount of switches on their main switch. If they have one main switch, it is **Single** phase. If they have three main switches, it is **Three** phase.
- The amount of fuses in their meterbox. One fuse means they are **Single** phase, while three fuses mean they are **Three** phase.

### Split (Two) Phase

Split (Two) Phase is a bit more special, as it is a more older/archaic form of electricity wiring. The main way to tell if a house is Split or Two phase is if they have two main switches, or two fuses. In this instance, typically these phases can be treated as Single Phase.

## How many kWh is someone's system?

Most homes in Australia run 6.6kW solar systems.

Sometimes, however, customers don't know how many kW their system is, in these instances, you typically want to wait for the customer to go home and figure it out. If they are unable to figure it out, the easiest way is to use OpenSolar if you have access to it, otherwise, look at their roof!

If their solar system was installed about 5 years ago, chances are they have 400W panels, beyond this time, they would most likely have 200W panels.

The easiest way to calculate this is to count each individual panel on the roof and multiply it by the panels watts, then finally, divide the result you get by 1,000. That would tell you the amount of kW's that a system is.

Can you tell how much solar is on this roof? Assume this is 400w panels and there are 20 panels.

If you calculated 8kW, you'd be correct.

## Installing Solar

Many people will be calling up to try and get Solar for the first time, usually not understanding whether their property is a good fit for it.

Usually, when installing panels, the installers prioritise these facing directions in this order:

- North (Most sunlight all-day)
- West (Sunlight gathered in the late afternoon)
- East (Sunlight gathered in the early morning)
- South (Little-to-no sunlight)

It's typically not worth installing on either the east or south, as the most energy comes during the peak hours located roughly between 11am-4pm.

If someone's roof is covered by shading from a tree or someone elses building, or they have a designer roof (you'll know based on the shape of the roof being abnormal) and it's impossible to install on either the north and west faces of the roof, it is usually not going to be worth installing solar for the person.

We prefer to install panels on metal or colorbond roofs. If the customer has a terracotta tiled roof, we can install the battery, but usually we don't install solar panels on these roofs due to the stability of these roofs and the frequent repairs needed to keep them functional.
